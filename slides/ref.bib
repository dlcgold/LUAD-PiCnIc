	abstract     = {{The driver genes play a key role in the evolutionary process of cancer. Effectively identifying these driver genes is crucial to cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, due to the high heterogeneity of cancers, it remains challenging to identify the driver genes for individual patients. Although some computational methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, they seldom consider the fact that the genes functionally similar to the well-established driver genes may likely play similar roles in cancer process, which potentially promotes the driver gene identification. Thus, here we developed a novel approach of IMCDriver to promote the driver gene identification both for cohorts and individual patients.IMCDriver first considers the well-established driver genes as prior information, and adopts the using multi-omics data (e.g. somatic mutation, gene expression and protein–protein interaction) to compute the similarity between patients/genes. Then, IMCDriver prioritizes the personalized mutated genes according to their functional similarity to the well-established driver genes via Inductive Matrix Completion. Finally, IMCDriver identifies the highly rank-ordered genes as the personalized driver genes. The results on five cancer datasets from the Cancer Genome Consortium show that our IMCDriver outperforms other existing state-of-the-art methods both in the cohort and patient-specific driver gene identification. IMCDriver also reveals some novel driver genes that potentially drive cancer development. In addition, even for the driver genes rarely mutated among a population, IMCDriver can still identify them and prioritize them with high priorities.Code available at https://github.com/NWPU-903PR/IMCDriver.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

Here we report molecular profiling of 230 resected lung adenocarcinomas using messenger RNA, microRNA and DNA sequencing integrated with copy number, methylation and proteomic analyses. High rates of somatic mutation were seen (mean 8.9 mutations per megabase). Eighteen genes were statistically significantly mutated, including RIT1 activating mutations and newly described loss-of-function MGA mutations which are mutually exclusive with focal MYC amplification. EGFR mutations were more frequent in female patients, whereas mutations in RBM10 were more common in males. Aberrations in NF1, MET, ERBB2 and RIT1 occurred in 13{\%} of cases and were enriched in samples otherwise lacking an activated oncogene, suggesting a driver role for these events in certain tumours. DNA and mRNA sequence from the same tumour highlighted splicing alterations driven by somatic genomic changes, including exon 14 skipping in MET mRNA in 4{\%} of cases. MAPK and PI(3)K pathway activity, when measured at the protein level, was explained by known mutations in only a fraction of cases, suggesting additional, unexplained mechanisms of pathway activation.

Although many important discoveries have been made by TCGA's research network, opportunities still exist to implement novel methods, thereby elucidating new biological pathways and diagnostic markers. However, mining the TCGA data presents several bioinformatics challenges, such as data retrieval and integration with clinical data and other molecular data types (e.g. RNA and DNA methylation). We developed an R/Bioconductor package called TCGAbiolinks to address these challenges and offer bioinformatics solutions by using a guided workflow to allow users to query, download and perform integrative analyses of TCGA data. We combined methods from computer science and statistics into the pipeline and incorporated methodologies developed in previous TCGA marker studies and in our own group. Using four different TCGA tumor types (Kidney, Brain, Breast and Colon) as examples, we provide case studies to illustrate examples of reproducibility, integrative analysis and utilization of different Bioconductor packages to advance and accelerate novel discoveries.}},

PiCnIc combines techniques for sample stratification, driver selection, and identification of fitness-equivalent exclusive alterations to exploit an algorithm based on Suppes{\textquoteright} probabilistic causation. The accuracy and translational significance of the results are studied in detail, with an application to colorectal cancer. The PiCnIc pipeline has been made publicly accessible for reproducibility, interoperability, and future enhancements.The genomic evolution inherent to cancer relates directly to a renewed focus on the voluminous next-generation sequencing data and machine learning for the inference of explanatory models of how the (epi)genomic events are choreographed in cancer initiation and development. However, despite the increasing availability of multiple additional -omics data, this quest has been frustrated by various theoretical and technical hurdles, mostly stemming from the dramatic heterogeneity of the disease. In this paper, we build on our recent work on the {\textquotedblleft}selective advantage{\textquotedblright} relation among driver mutations in cancer progression and investigate its applicability to the modeling problem at the population level. Here, we introduce PiCnIc (Pipeline for Cancer Inference), a versatile, modular, and customizable pipeline to extract ensemble-level progression models from cross-sectional sequenced cancer genomes. The pipeline has many translational implications because it combines state-of-the-art techniques for sample stratification, driver selection, identification of fitness-equivalent exclusive alterations, and progression model inference. We demonstrate PiCnIc{\textquoteright}s ability to reproduce much of the current knowledge on colorectal cancer progression as well as to suggest novel experimentally verifiable hypotheses.},

The efficiency of these analyses, particularly for infrequently mutated genes, is compromised when subjects carry different combinations of driver mutations. Mutual exclusivity analysis helps address these challenges. To identify mutually exclusive gene sets (MEGS), we developed a powerful and flexible analytic framework based on a likelihood ratio test and a model selection procedure. Extensive simulations demonstrated that our method outperformed existing methods for both statistical power and the capability of identifying the exact MEGS, particularly for highly imbalanced MEGS. Our method can be used for de novo discovery, for pathway-guided searches, or for expanding established small MEGS. We applied our method to the whole-exome sequencing data for 13 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We identified multiple previously unreported non-pairwise MEGS in multiple cancer types. For acute myeloid leukemia, we identified a MEGS with five genes (FLT3, IDH2, NRAS, KIT, and TP53) and a MEGS (NPM1, TP53, and RUNX1) whose mutation status was strongly associated with survival (p = 6.7 {\texttimes} 10(-4)). For breast cancer, we identified a significant MEGS consisting of TP53 and four infrequently mutated genes (ARID1A, AKT1, MED23, and TBL1XR1), providing support for their role as cancer drivers.},

Our empirical analysis of the accuracy and convergence rate of our algorithm, CAncer PRogression Inference (CAPRI), shows that it outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms addressing similar problems.Motivation: Several cancer-related genomic data have become available (e.g. The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA) typically involving hundreds of patients. At present, most of these data are aggregated in a cross-sectional fashion providing all measurements at the time of diagnosis. Our goal is to infer cancer ‘progression’ models from such data. These models are represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of collections of ‘selectivity’ relations, where a mutation in a gene A ‘selects’ for a later mutation in a gene B. Gaining insight into the structure of such progressions has the potential to improve both the stratification of patients and personalized therapy choices.Results: The CAPRI algorithm relies on a scoring method based on a probabilistic theory developed by Suppes, coupled with bootstrap and maximum likelihood inference. The resulting algorithm is efficient, achieves high accuracy and has good complexity, also, in terms of convergence properties. CAPRI performs especially well in the presence of noise in the data, and with limited sample sizes. Moreover CAPRI, in contrast to other approaches, robustly reconstructs different types of confluent trajectories despite irregularities in the data. We also report on an ongoing investigation using CAPRI to study atypical Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, in which we uncovered non trivial selectivity relations and exclusivity patterns among key genomic events.Availability and implementation: CAPRI is part of the TRanslational ONCOlogy R package and is freely available on the web at: http://bimib.disco.unimib.it/index.php/TroncoContact:daniele.ramazzotti@disco.unimib.itSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

The order in which aberrations occur is not arbitrary, and inferring the order of events is challenging due to the lack of longitudinal samples from tumors. Moreover, a network model of oncogenesis should capture biological facts such as distinct progression trajectories of cancer subtypes and patterns of mutual exclusivity of alterations in the same pathways. In this paper, we present the disjunctive Bayesian network (DBN), a novel oncogenetic model with a phylogenetic interpretation. DBN is expressive enough to capture cancer subtypes' trajectories and mutually exclusive relations between alterations from unstratified data. Results: In cases where the number of studied alterations is small (<30), we provide an efficient dynamic programming implementation of an exact structure learning method that finds a best DBN in the superexponential search space of networks. In rare cases that the number of alterations is large, we provided an efficient genetic algorithm in our software package, OncoBN. Through numerous synthetic and real data experiments, we show OncoBN's ability in inferring ground truth networks and recovering biologically meaningful progression networks. Availability: OncoBN is implemented in R and is available at https://github.com/phillipnicol/OncoBN.}

	abstract     = {{Motivation: We introduce TRanslational ONCOlogy (TRONCO), an open-source R package that implements the state-of-the-art algorithms for the inference of cancer progression models from (epi)genomic mutational profiles. TRONCO can be used to extract population-level models describing the trends of accumulation of alterations in a cohort of cross-sectional samples, e.g. retrieved from publicly available databases, and individual-level models that reveal the clonal evolutionary history in single cancer patients, when multiple samples, e.g. multiple biopsies or single-cell sequencing data, are available. The resulting models can provide key hints for uncovering the evolutionary trajectories of cancer, especially for precision medicine or personalized therapy.Availability and implementation: TRONCO is released under the GPL license, is hosted at http://bimib.disco.unimib.it/ (Software section) and archived also at bioconductor.org.Contact:tronco@disco.unimib.itSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}}
